# DigitalFuelAnalyzer
This was my final year project.
Project Summary : - 
The current fuel demonstrating framework in-vehicle indicates surmised status of fuel level.  So, we cannot judge the actual fuel present in the fuel tank. In analog meter, the fuel level is displayed by using a needle. But due to this, we do not get a proper idea about the fuel level present in the fuel tank. Due to improper knowledge of fuel present in the tank, we can undergo in trouble due to low fuel. As considering the previous analog system we are going to implement an advanced system. In our system, we are implementing a digital fuel analyzer. In digital fuel meter, we are indicating the amount of fuel in the tank in liters. The exact amount of fuel available in the tank will be displayed digitally by making the use of the Ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensor is a non-contact sensor, with low power requirements and good accuracy. It overcomes the problems faced by other gauges and is suitable for the non-contact measurement of the fuel inside the tank. The data acquired from the sensor is given to the microcontroller. The processor processes the data by calculating the liter value that sends to the display unit. This project mainly concentrates on the digital indication of fuel in the vehicleâ€™s tank. We will use Firebase to fetch real-time data from the chip-sensor to the android application. So that the fuel quantity can also be checked through mobile phone in real-time.
